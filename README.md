<h3>Description<h3>
<h5>Boulder Dash is a game about a diamond chase underground with many obstacles. In original version the main character is Rockford. So do we here. Totally there are 5 levels, the main idea is to collect as more as you can. However, winner is that, who collect ALL diamonds. Strategy and thoughtful planning is the basis to master this game.<h5/>

<h5>Rockford can dig through the ground and push rocks. But these can also be dangerous. If he stands directly below a rock, Rockford can hold it on his head. But if a rock falls on his head, it will cost him a life. So the game is over. Rocks will not stay on each other or on walls. If Rockford digs away the supporting soil, rocks will start to slide. <h5/>
